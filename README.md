# One-In-A-Melon
This iPhone app predicts a watermelon's brix value, which is a sugar content scale, only by the sound emitted when you thump it. This is done by breaking the audio signal using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). Which is a mathematical process that breakdowns an audio signal into individual frequencies. Once the audio is broken down the app will determine specific characteristics from the FFT and audio signal and multiply those values by coefficients from a linear regression. The app is fully functional and will have predictions with about 10% error
